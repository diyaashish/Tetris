// details : 

addEventListener(): It is used to attach an event handler function to an element. The function will be executed when the specified event occurs on that element.

querySelector(): It returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector. It searches for the element within the document and returns null if no element is found.

querySelectorAll(): It returns a NodeList containing all the elements that match a specified CSS selector. The NodeList represents a collection of elements and can be iterated over using methods like forEach().

keyCode(): There is no built-in JavaScript method named keyCode(). However, it is commonly used in event handling to retrieve the key code of a key that triggered the event.

Math.floor(): It is a Math object method that returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.

Math.random(): It is a Math object method that generates a random decimal number between 0 and 1 (exclusive of 1).

length: It is a property available on arrays, strings, and other objects that represents the number of elements or characters in the object.

forEach(): It is an array method that executes a provided function once for each element in an array.

splice(): It is an array method that changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

clearInterval(): It is used to stop the execution of a function repeatedly called by setInterval(). It takes the interval ID returned by setInterval() as an argument.

setInterval(): It is a function that repeatedly calls a specified function or executes a code snippet with a fixed time delay between each call.

some(): It is an array method that tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function.

innerHTML(): There is no built-in JavaScript method named innerHTML(). However, it is a property available on HTML elements, and it represents the HTML content within the element.

every(): It is an array method that tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.

add(): There is no built-in JavaScript method named add(). It may refer to a custom method or a method from a library you're using.

remove(): It is a method available on some JavaScript objects, such as DOM elements, and is used to remove an element from the document.

contains(): There is no built-in JavaScript method named contains(). It may refer to a custom method or a method from a library you're using.
